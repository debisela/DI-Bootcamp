ðŸŒŸ Exercise 1: Intersection Types
What You Will Learn:
Combine multiple types into one.
Create a type that includes all properties from several types.
Task
Define an intersection type PersonWithAddress that combines Person and Address types. Create a variable of this type with properties from both types.
The Person type should contain name and age, the Address type should contain street and city,*/
const person1 = {
    name: "John",
    age: 23,
    street: "Ben Gurion",
    city: "Tel Aviv"
};
// ðŸŒŸ Exercise 2: Type Guards with Union Types
// What You Will Learn
// Use type guards to handle different types.
// Perform actions based on the input type.
// Task
// Create a function describeValue that accepts number | string. Use type guards to return a description based on the input type:
// "This is a number" for numbers.
// "This is a string" for strings.
function describeValue(a) {
    if (typeof a === "number") {
        return "this is a number";
    }
    else {
        return "this is a string";
    }
}
// ðŸŒŸ Exercise 3: Type Casting
// What You Will Learn
// Convert a variable from one type to another using type casting.
// Understand the difference between type casting and type assertions.
// Task
// Create a variable someValue of type any and cast it to a string. Then, use it as a string.
let someValue = "this is a string";
let stringValue = someValue;
console.log(stringValue);
// ðŸŒŸ Exercise 4: Type Assertions with Union Types
// What You Will Learn
// Use type assertions to specify a type.
// Handle variables with union types.
// Task
// Create a function getFirstElement that takes an array of number | string and uses type assertions to return the first element as a string. Test with arrays of mixed types.
function getFirstElement(arr) {
    return arr[0];
}
console.log(getFirstElement(["hello", 42])); // Output: "hello"
// ðŸŒŸ Exercise 5: Generic Constraints
// What You Will Learn
// Use generic constraints to limit type usage.
// Create a generic function that works with constrained types.
// Task
// Create a generic function logLength that takes a parameter of type T constrained to types with a length property (like string or Array). The function should log the length.
const logLength = (a) => {
    console.log(a.length);
};
function describeEmployee(a) {
    if (a.position === 'Manager') {
        return `${a.name} is a Manager at ${a.department}`;
    }
    else if (a.position === 'Developer') {
        return `${a.name} is a Developer at ${a.department}`;
    }
    else {
        return `${a.name} is a ${a.position} at ${a.department}`;
    }
}
const employee1 = {
    name: "John",
    age: 35,
    position: "Manager",
    department: "Sales"
};
const employee2 = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 28,
    position: "Developer",
    department: "Engineering"
};
const employee3 = {
    name: "Jane",
    age: 28,
    position: "Doctor",
    department: "Hospital"
};
console.log(describeEmployee(employee1));
console.log(describeEmployee(employee2));
console.log(describeEmployee(employee3));
// ðŸŒŸ Exercise 7: Type Assertions and Generic Constraints
// What You Will Learn
// Use type assertions to refine types in complex scenarios.
// Apply generic constraints to ensure type safety.
// Task
// Create a generic function formatInput that takes a parameter of type T constrained to have a toString() method. Use type assertions to ensure the parameter is treated as a string for formatting. The function should format the input as a string.
const formatInput = (a) => {
    const formattedInput = a.toString().toUpperCase();
    return `formatted: ${formattedInput}`;
};
console.log(formatInput("hello"));
console.log(formatInput(123));
console.log(formatInput(false));
