/*
ðŸŒŸ Exercise 1: Intersection Types
What You Will Learn:
Combine multiple types into one.
Create a type that includes all properties from several types.
Task
Define an intersection type PersonWithAddress that combines Person and Address types. Create a variable of this type with properties from both types.
The Person type should contain name and age, the Address type should contain street and city,*/

// type Person = {name: string, age: number}
type Address ={street: string, city: string}

type PersonWithAddress = Person & Address

const person1: PersonWithAddress = {
    name: "John",
    age: 23,
    street: "Ben Gurion",
    city: "Tel Aviv"
}



// ðŸŒŸ Exercise 2: Type Guards with Union Types
// What You Will Learn
// Use type guards to handle different types.
// Perform actions based on the input type.
// Task
// Create a function describeValue that accepts number | string. Use type guards to return a description based on the input type:

// "This is a number" for numbers.
// "This is a string" for strings.

function describeValue(a:number|string):string{
    if (typeof a === "number"){
        return "this is a number"
    } else {
        return "this is a string"
    }
}


// ðŸŒŸ Exercise 3: Type Casting
// What You Will Learn
// Convert a variable from one type to another using type casting.
// Understand the difference between type casting and type assertions.
// Task
// Create a variable someValue of type any and cast it to a string. Then, use it as a string.

let someValue:any = "this is a string"
let stringValue = someValue as string;
console.log(stringValue);


// ðŸŒŸ Exercise 4: Type Assertions with Union Types
// What You Will Learn
// Use type assertions to specify a type.
// Handle variables with union types.
// Task
// Create a function getFirstElement that takes an array of number | string and uses type assertions to return the first element as a string. Test with arrays of mixed types.

function getFirstElement(arr: (number | string)[]): string {
  return arr[0] as string;
}

console.log(getFirstElement(["hello", 42])); // Output: "hello"


// ðŸŒŸ Exercise 5: Generic Constraints
// What You Will Learn
// Use generic constraints to limit type usage.
// Create a generic function that works with constrained types.
// Task
// Create a generic function logLength that takes a parameter of type T constrained to types with a length property (like string or Array). The function should log the length.

const logLength = <T>(a:T[]):void=>{
console.log(a.length);

}

// ðŸŒŸ Exercise 6: Intersection Types and Type Guards
// What You Will Learn
// Combine types using intersection types.
// Use type guards to handle complex types safely.
// Task
// Define a type Employee that combines Person and Job using intersection types. Create a function describeEmployee that takes an Employee object and uses type guards to return a description based on whether the Job is a Manager or a Developer.

// Person type: name: string; age: number;
// Job type: position: string; department: string;
// Employee type should combine these.
// describeEmployee should return a specific message for each type of job.
type Person = {name: string, age: number}
type Job = {position: string, department:string}
type Employee = Person & Job;
function describeEmployee(a:Employee):string{
    if(a.position === 'Manager'){
        return `${a.name} is a Manager at ${a.department}`
    } else if (a.position === 'Developer'){
         return `${a.name} is a Developer at ${a.department}`
    }
    else {
        return `${a.name} is a ${a.position} at ${a.department}`
    }
}

const employee1: Employee = {
    name: "John",
    age: 35,
    position: "Manager",
    department: "Sales"
  };
  
  const employee2: Employee = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 28,
    position: "Developer",
    department: "Engineering"
  };

  const employee3: Employee = {
    name: "Jane",
    age: 28,
    position: "Doctor",
    department: "Hospital"
  };

  console.log(describeEmployee(employee1));
  console.log(describeEmployee(employee2));
  console.log(describeEmployee(employee3));
  


// ðŸŒŸ Exercise 7: Type Assertions and Generic Constraints
// What You Will Learn
// Use type assertions to refine types in complex scenarios.
// Apply generic constraints to ensure type safety.
// Task
// Create a generic function formatInput that takes a parameter of type T constrained to have a toString() method. Use type assertions to ensure the parameter is treated as a string for formatting. The function should format the input as a string.

const formatInput = <T>(a:T):string=>{
    const formattedInput = (a as any).toString().toUpperCase();
    return `formatted: ${formattedInput}`
}
console.log(formatInput("hello"));
console.log(formatInput(123));
console.log(formatInput(false));
